            <p class="lead" style="padding:3rem;">Yoga Kanneboina is a junior at Dublin High School and has been interested in engineering ever since she started working with Lego robotics in elementary school. She has taken Computer Science Principles, honors Principles of Engineering, and AP Computer Science A. She has always been fascinated with image recognition in computer science. Her first image recognition project was in 2017 when she manipulated images with Python. In her AP Computer Science class, she was amazed at the applications of machine learning and how much it could help others. Yoga loves learning new languages and wanted to look into how people used American Sign Language. This is one of the reasons for why she and her team wanted to try and create a program that made it easier for people who use ASL to communicate with others.</p>

            <p class="lead" style="padding:4rem;">Jenny Wang is a junior in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High. She has always been passionate about language, studying over four languages throughout her entire life and being fluent in English, Mandarin, Spanish and French. She has a strong foundation in linguistics, visual and performing arts. After taking her first engineering course in 2018, Principles of Engineering, she became fascinated with computer science and she decided to participate in a coding camp over the summer. At the camp, she was inspired by what she learned about artificial intelligence and machine learning and her dream of creating a translation app between ASL and spoken English was born. Jenny continues to learn about computer science and image manipulation by taking her first computer science course in 2019. As someone who is invested in both linguistics and computer science, this project definitely has a lot of personal meaning to her. </p>

            <p class="lead" style="padding:3rem;">Samiksha Yelthimar is currently a junior in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy. In her three years as a member of DEDA, she has explored her interests in computer science and engineering by taking Computer Science Principles (2018), Principles of Engineering (2019), and AP Computer Science Applications (2020). She is passionate about the intersection of computer science, data analytics, and machine learning and aspires to pursue these fields in college and beyond.  Samiksha was inspired to create Sign-In with her teammates because  her closest neighbors growing up were deaf and she understands first hand the difficulties encountered in communication between those who are deaf and those who can hear. Through Sign-In, she aims to help bridge the communication divide and make it easy for people of all ages and backgrounds to communicate.</p>
