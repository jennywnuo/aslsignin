# ASL Sign In Promotional Website 
Designed and created by Jenny Wang 


Our goal for the website is to make it as user friendly as possible in order to make it possible for countless people to be able to ultimately access our app. We made a logo and placed it on the top left of our website in order to present ourself in a professional manner. The website states the problem statement under the “Our Mission” page and also offers a link for the user to download the program. Next, we have a “Feature” page which explains what our ASL to text program is capable of and what improvements we can add on to it. We also have an “About Us” page in order to explain how each of us were inspired to make this app and what experience we have. Finally, we have a “Contact Us” page to contact us.
